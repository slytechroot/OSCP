Introduction
Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source and versatile network scanning tool widely used in cybersecurity and IT fields. Developed by Gordon Lyon (Fyodor), it helps security professionals, network administrators, and penetration testers to map out networks, discover
active hosts, and identify open ports and services. With its extensive scripting engine and wide range of scan options, Nmap is an essential tool for network auditing and security analysis. Key Features of Nmap Nmap is a powerful tool with a variety of features designed for network discovery,
analysis, and security assessment. 

Here are its key features:
1. Network Discovery
Identifies active hosts within a network.
Maps the network topology, uncovering relationships between devices.

2. Port Scanning
Scans for open, closed, or filtered ports on target systems.
Supports scanning individual ports, specific port ranges, or all 65,535 ports.

3. Service Version Detection
Determines the type and version of services running on open ports.
Helps identify vulnerabilities associated with outdated services.

4. Operating System Detection
Detects the operating system of target devices, including version details and hardware information.
Useful for profiling target systems during penetration testing.

5. Scripting Engine (NSE)
Executes custom or built-in scripts to perform advanced tasks such as:
Vulnerability detection.
Malware identification.
Service enumeration.
Network policy compliance checks.
Includes pre-built scripts for specific use cases, such as identifying CVEs or SQL injection.

6. Aggressive Scanning
Combines service version detection, OS detection, and traceroute in a single scan to gather comprehensive data about a target.

7. Output Customization
Generates reports in multiple formats:
Normal (-oN), XML (-oX), and grepable (-oG) formats.
Supports saving outputs for later analysis or integration with other tools.

8. Flexible Scanning Techniques
Offers a variety of scan modes to suit different needs:
SYN Scan (-sS): Stealthy and efficient.
TCP Connect Scan (-sT): Establishes a full TCP connection.
UDP Scan (-sU): Explores open UDP ports.
Ping Scan (-sP): Detects live hosts without performing port scans.

9. IPv6 Support
Fully supports IPv6 scanning to accommodate modern network configurations.

10. Speed and Timing Control
Adjustable scanning speed to balance efficiency and stealth.
-T4 for fast scans.
-T0 for highly stealthy scans.

11. Traceroute
Maps the path packets take to reach the target.
Identifies intermediate devices and networks in the route.

12. Vulnerability Assessment
Leverages NSE scripts to detect specific vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, such as:
SQL injection.
Weak SSL/TLS ciphers.
Open SMB shares.

13. Advanced Packet Manipulation
Customizes packet data, length, and checksum to evade detection or tailor scans for specific targets.

14. Security and Privacy Testing
Detects web application vulnerabilities, HTTP headers, and SSL certificate issues.
Performs brute-forcing and checks for anonymous login possibilities in FTP or SMB protocols.

Categories of Commands
Basic Scans: Commands for scanning single targets, multiple targets, ranges, or subnets.
Port Scans: Includes specific port scans, all-port scans, and common-port scans.
Service and OS Detection: Commands for identifying service versions and operating systems.
Advanced Scans: Techniques like TCP connect, SYN, and UDP scans, as well as aggressive scanning.
