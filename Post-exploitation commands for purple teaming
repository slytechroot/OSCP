 Post-exploitation commands for purple teaming

Here are some benign commands that can be used for post-exploitation exercises:

    System Information:
        systeminfo - Retrieve system information, including the OS version and installed hotfixes.
        hostname - Display the hostname of the compromised system.
        whoami - Identify the current user.

    File System Exploration:
        dir - List files and directories in the current directory.
        cd - Change the current directory.
        type - Display the contents of a text file.
        copy - Copy files from one location to another.

    Process Management:
        tasklist - List running processes.
        taskkill - Terminate a running process.

    User Management:
        net user - List user accounts on the system.
        net localgroup administrators - List users in the local administrators group.

    Network Information:
        ipconfig - Display network configuration information.
        netstat - Show active network connections.
        ping - Test network connectivity to a host.

    Privilege Escalation (if applicable):
        runas - Attempt to run a command with different user credentials.
        PowerShell -Command "Start-Process cmd.exe -Verb RunAs" - Elevate a command prompt to run with administrator privileges.

    Data Exfiltration Prevention (Demonstrative):
        Create a benign text file containing simulated sensitive information and attempt to copy it to an external location.

    Registry Access:
        reg query - View registry key values.
        reg add - Add registry key values (caution: only for authorized purposes).

    Event Log Manipulation (if authorized):
        wevtutil - Manage event logs.
        powershell.exe -Command "Clear-EventLog -LogName Security" - Clear event logs (only with authorization).

    Persistence Techniques (Demonstrative):
        Create a scheduled task to run a benign script or command periodically.
        Add an entry to the Windows Registry Run key for a benign script or program.

Remember, the primary goal of these commands in a purple teaming exercise is not to exploit or compromise systems further but to assess and improve security controls, as well as to facilitate collaboration between red and blue teams. Always conduct these exercises in a controlled, authorized, and ethical manner.
