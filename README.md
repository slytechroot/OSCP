1. Look at each VM independently without losing your focus on the big picture. For example, say you are targeting an email server. You want to focus on compromising it independently of how you did other VMs but don't lose sight of it being an email server and could be leveraged in many ways to penetrate
further.
2. When you have spent a lot of time on a VM, lock your computer, take a deep breath and walk around for a few minutes. I found that if I focused too intently on a box for awhile, I would sort of get tunnel vision and lose site of low hanging fruits.
3. Information gathering is truly key as they suggested in the material. Pull as much info on every service as possible. For example, say you are targeting a web server. What is the underlying web server platform?
4. What web apps are running? What HTTP verbs are allowed? Is webdav enabled? Are their information disclosure pages? Is there a phpmyadmin page?

Hope any of this helps. Good luck!
