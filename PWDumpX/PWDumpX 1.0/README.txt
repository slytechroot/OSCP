1. SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS

This tool was tested against and works with the following operating
systems:

Windows NT 4.0
Windows 2000
Windows XP
Windows Server 2003



2. PWDUMPX FEATURES

PWDumpX version 1.0 allows a user with administrative privileges to
retrieve the encrypted password hashes and LSA secrets from a Windows
system. This tool can be used on the local system or on one or more
remote systems.

If an input list of remote systems is supplied, PWDumpX will attempt to
obtain the encrypted password hashes and the LSA secrets from each
remote Windows system in a multi-threaded fashion (up to 64 systems
simultaneously).

The encrypted password hash information and the LSA secret information
from remote Windows systems is encrypted as it is transfered over the
network. No data is sent over the network in clear text.

This tool is a completely re-written version of PWDump3e and LSADump2
which integrates suggestions/bug fixes for PWDump3e and LSADump2 found
on various web sites, etc.



3. HOW TO USE PWDUMPX

Usage: PWDumpX <hostname | ip input file> <username> <password>

<hostname | ip input file>  -- required argument
<username>                  -- required argument
<password>                  -- required argument

If the <username> and <password> arguments are both plus signs (+), the
existing credentials of the user running this utility will be used.

Examples:
PWDumpX 10.10.10.10 + +
PWDumpX 10.10.10.10 administrator password

PWDumpX MyWindowsMachine + +
PWDumpX MyWindowsMachine administrator password

PWDumpX IPInputFile.txt + +
PWDumpX IPInputFile.txt administrator password



4. CREDITS

My intent with including the source code along with this tool is to
give something back to the I.T. security community. I learned a lot
while creating PWDumpX but I could not have done it without the
original source code for PWDump2, PWDump3e, and LSADump2. So...thanks
to the creators of these tools for being generous enough to include the
source code with these tools so that hungry minds can learn new things.



5. QUESTIONS, BUGS, ETC.

Please send all comments, suggestions, bugs, etc. to me. I will do my
best to find the time to make corrections if need be. Thank you.
