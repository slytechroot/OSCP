 Benign customized macros for purple teaming

 

Purple teaming is a collaborative approach where red and blue teams work together to enhance overall cybersecurity. It typically involves testing, improving, and validating security measures. Here's an example of a benign customized VBA macro for purple teaming purposes. This macro simulates a basic file encryption process:

vba

Sub PurpleTeamFileEncryption()
    Dim SourceFilePath As String
    Dim DestinationFilePath As String
    Dim FileContent As String
    Dim EncryptedContent As String
    Dim FileNumber As Integer
    
    ' Define the source file path (customize as needed)
    SourceFilePath = "C:\Path\To\ImportantFile.txt"
    
    ' Define the destination file path (customize as needed)
    DestinationFilePath = "C:\Path\To\EncryptedFile.txt"
    
    ' Attempt to open the source file for input
    FileNumber = FreeFile
    Open SourceFilePath For Input As FileNumber
    
    ' Check if the source file was successfully opened
    If FileNumber <> 0 Then
        ' Read the content of the source file
        FileContent = Input$(LOF(FileNumber), FileNumber)
        
        ' Close the source file
        Close FileNumber
        
        ' Perform a basic encryption (e.g., reversing the content)
        EncryptedContent = StrReverse(FileContent)
        
        ' Write the encrypted content to the destination file
        FileNumber = FreeFile
        Open DestinationFilePath For Output As FileNumber
        Print #FileNumber, EncryptedContent
        Close FileNumber
        
        ' Display a message indicating successful encryption
        MsgBox "File encryption complete. Encrypted content saved to " & DestinationFilePath
    Else
        ' Handle the case where the source file cannot be opened
        MsgBox "Error: Could not open the source file."
    End If
End Sub

This macro reads the content of a specified source file, reverses it as a simple form of encryption, and then saves the encrypted content to a destination file. You can customize the SourceFilePath and DestinationFilePath variables with the appropriate file paths for your purple teaming exercise.

Remember, the purpose of purple teaming is to improve security practices and collaboration, not to engage in adversarial activities. Always conduct these exercises in a controlled and authorized environment.
